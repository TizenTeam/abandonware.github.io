## MAINTAIN: ##

As I said, elsewhere as creator of @abandonware org, I am open to co-maintainership,
but it's hard to trust everyone, specially when taking over orphan packages.
So I don't want to put users under any risk.

In short term, I propose this rule:

Any developer can apply but he should already has committed to an opensource organisation that he will behave nicely (to not intentionally commit malicious code), An explicit proof of commitment should be provided too.

Example:

* https://github.com/abandonware/noble/pull/10

I am open to suggestions.

Tracking changes is also welcome, ask me how if unsure:

## ADOPT: ##

Abandonware org can be seen as orphanage, it's preferable to find new parents for projects staging in this area,
but to avoid any malicious threat, intend to adopt should be justified in an issue in downstream project.
