## ADOPT: ##

As I said, elsewhere as creator of @abandonware org, I am open to co maintainership,
but it's hard to trust everyone, specially when taking over orphan packages. So I don't want to put users under any risk.

In short term, I propose this rule:

Any developer can apply but he should already has committed to an opensource organisation that he will behave nicely (to not intentionally commit malicious code), An explicit proof of commitment should be provided too.

Example:
